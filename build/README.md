This is our repository for the application UThrift team Mango will be develuping
Our application will provide similar services to Craigslist enabling users to connect with other UMass students to purchase school related items.
These items will be seperated into on the first level into the catogories: Textbooks, Clothing, Technology, Events, Furniture, Misc
There will be subclassification allowing users to search for specific items OR content related to a specific class.
